# Snakes-and-Ladders

My first ever programming task
- Default 2v2 snakes and ladders with a standard size board of 100 positions and 5 snakes and 5 ladders. Can play either automatic whereby the computer plays for you or interactive whereby each player manually roles the dice.
- Custom game where any size board is permitted, any number of players is permitted, any number of snakes and ladders is permitted and can be played automatically or interactively. No illegal positions can be placed for the snakes and ladders. Such as the snakes going up instead of down and vice versa for the ladders.Also no two snakes or ladders can be placed on the same square.
